There are two broad categories of tools available to us for testing concurrent code. 

- The first enables us to produce reasonably high stress on the concurrent code with many threads. Stress increases the likelihood of rare interleaving and, thus, increases our chances of finding defects.

- The second enables us to simulate specific thread interleaving, thereby helping us find defects with more certainty
